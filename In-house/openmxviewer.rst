Using OpenMX Viewer to visualize the molecular dynamics
=======================================================

Molecules and crystals can be visualized using softwares such as `XCrySDen <http://www.xcrysden.org>`_, `VESTA <https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/>`_ and `VMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_, but sometimes there are difficulties in installing these softwares into the computer we are using, say during a workshop like the CMD workshop. In such a circumstance, it is quite useful to use web-based tools. Among others, I find `OpenMX Viewer <http://www.openmx-square.org/viewer/index.html>`_ very useful. Below, I describe how to use OpenMX Viewer by using the C\ :sub:`2`\H\ :sub:`4`\  as an example.

Visit the `OpenMX Viewer <http://www.openmx-square.org/viewer/index.html>`_ site:

Download your trajectory file, say, `traj.xyz <https://github.com/ikuhamada/state-examples/tree/cmd_beginner/C2H4/References/traj.xyz>`_ to your local computer, and then drag and drop your trajectory file as suggested in the web page (see below):

Then you can see the following image:

By clicking the ``>>`` botton, you can see the atoms moving.
